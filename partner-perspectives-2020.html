                                                think it may be a psychological phenomenon that we look back and pine
                                                for
                                                the days that were simpler and calmer. But if we are honest with
                                                ourselves,
                                                there has never been a time without turmoil. Clearly, we have been in an
                                                extended period where the old adage “the market climbs a wall of worry”
                                                has
                                                reigned. We like to say that this is the most unloved bull market in

                                        safety. When it comes to equities, they tend to look for profitable business
                                        with good returns and cleaner balance sheets. We saw a great example of this in
                                        September when quality began to outperform and profitable businesses
                                        significantly outperformed non-earners.

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">It is clear that global growth has slowed due to a
                                                variety of factors. The U.S.-China trade war and lingering Brexit
                                                overhang, despite some recent improvements on both fronts, are the most
                                                obvious proximal causes. We also believe the impact of the Fed’s
                                                tightening cycle was not fully appreciated while it was ongoing, as the
                                                effects were being somewhat masked and offset by fiscal stimulus
                                                stemming from the 2017 tax cuts.

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">As the fourth quarter of 2018 began, the Fed was
                                                contemplating more rate increases and balance sheet reduction was on
                                                “autopilot” despite signs that growth and inflation were already
                                                decelerating. The abrupt policy shift and subsequent “mid-cycle
                                                adjustment” of three 25 bps rate cuts have blunted the impact of the
                                                slowdown and reduced the likelihood of a U.S recession. Europe is still
                                                in a perilous state, however, as Germany, France, and Italy are all
                                                flirting with recessions. China has also been employing all manner of
                                                fiscal and monetary stimulus to keep its growth rate above 6%, but
                                                continues to print disappointing economic numbers.

                                            </p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">The key question is: Can the U.S. consumer hold up
                                                long enough for the manufacturing sector to recover? U.S. and Eurozone
                                                manufacturing PMIs have both weakened notably and are now below 50,
                                                indicating contraction, while China’s PMI has been (suspiciously)
                                                hovering around 50 for the past year with little variability. Global
                                                services PMIs, which are less exposed to the dual threats of the
                                                U.S.-China trade war and Brexit, have proven more resilient and remain
                                                in expansion territory. The U.S. consumer, buoyed by historically low
                                                unemployment, has been one of the only bright spots globally.

                                            </p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">The overriding hope is that a comprehensive trade
                                                deal gets done before the consumer rolls over and potentially tips the
                                                U.S. into a recession. There are a couple of issues, however, with this
                                                otherwise bullish scenario. First, although market participants are
                                                concerned about the U.S.-China trade war, some sort of favorable
                                                resolution appears to be largely priced in at this point. This is
                                                similar to the situation earlier in 2019, when a breakdown in talks
                                                between the U.S. and China roiled markets in May. The reaction to these
                                                developments made it clear that the consensus belief was that a deal was
                                                inevitable, and markets seem to believe that to be the case once again.

                                            </p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">Second, a quick fix to this issue may not actually
                                                exist. “Phase one” of a trade deal is expected to be signed in early
                                                January, although certain details have yet to be released. In the main,
                                                additional tariffs set to go into effect on December 15 were avoided,
                                                the U.S. agreed to reduce tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese goods, and
                                                China agreed to import more U.S. goods, primarily agricultural products.
                                                This is not a comprehensive trade deal, however, and should be viewed
                                                more like a temporary armistice than a lasting peace treaty. Some of the
                                                near-term tail risk has been reduced, but there are still a number of
                                                critical long-term issues that need to be addressed.

                                            </p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">China has been hurt more by the trade war than the
                                                U.S. has, but China has also dug in and does not seem willing to “lose”
                                                on a deal with the U.S. Similarly, the Trump administration cannot
                                                stomach a deal that appears to capitulate to China. Inking a minor deal
                                                heading into an election year turns down the heat a bit and lowers U.S.
                                                recession risk, which is certainly desirable from President Trump’s
                                                standpoint.
                                            </p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">That is perhaps all we should expect until after
                                                the 2020 presidential election, however, and there will undoubtedly be
                                                more ups and downs along the way. The U.S. has more leverage on the
                                                actual terms of trade since it represents a much higher percentage of
                                                China’s exports than vice versa, but China has time on its side and a
                                                radically different political economy. President Xi Jinping certainly
                                                faces some internal pressures, but China can afford to wait out the U.S.
                                                election cycle before signing a comprehensive trade deal. They can bide
                                                their time either to apply more negotiating pressure as election day
                                                approaches, or with a view towards picking up talks with potentially a
                                                new incoming administration that would likely be less adversarial. So in
                                                our view, it is entirely possible that trade tensions between the two
                                                largest economies in the world will persist longer than many are
                                                projecting.

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">Speaking of the U.S. presidential election, this
                                                particular one is setting up to have a larger than normal impact on bond
                                                markets. Aside from President Trump winning re-election or not, a lot
                                                depends on who becomes the Democratic candidate. Barring any surprises
                                                we are likely to have a status-quo moderate, but there is potential for
                                                a progressive candidate in either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. If
                                                Warren or Sanders is the Democratic nominee, we would expect heightened
                                                market volatility leading up to the election. Either of these candidates
                                                would be viewed as broadly negative for business and markets (in
                                                contrast to a more centrist Democratic candidate), and sectors such as
                                                healthcare, financials, and energy could suffer disproportionately based
                                                on the two progressive candidates’ likely policy agendas, if elected.

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">Should Warren or Sanders win, we can also expect
                                                big changes on the policy front or attempted changes, that is. A
                                                Republican-majority Senate would do whatever it can to block any
                                                sweeping reforms, leading to more incremental changes via executive
                                                order. We don’t spend much time trying to predict these sorts of things
                                                or laying out multiple branching scenarios that might unfold. But the
                                                one big-picture item that we would be closely monitoring, in the event
                                                that Trump or a more moderate Democrat is not at the helm, is some sort
                                                of massive fiscal spending bill. The U.S. is already running a $1
                                                trillion annual budget deficit, so any large-scale fiscal package like
                                                the Green New Deal or Medicare-for-All would add substantially to the
                                                deficit and potentially cause ripple effects in the bond and currency
                                                markets.

                                                long been guilty of unfair practices, including theft of intellectual
                                                property, but tariffs are a blunt instrument, and China is willing to
                                                play the long game, partly because it has no voters to appease and
                                                partly because Donald Trump will likely want to settle and declare some
                                                kind of a victory coming into his re-election campaign.

                                                U.S.-China trade war are export-led countries that sell components in
                                                China that are included in onward trade to the U.S. According to a
                                                recent Reuters poll, half of Japanese companies have seen their profits
                                                hurt by this trade war. China also plays a huge role in the global
                                                automotive supply chain; many components that appear in U.S.- made cars
                                                come from China. Technology is another industry at the forefront of the
                                                U.S. tariff policy as many U.S. semiconductor chip makers and
                                                electronics manufacturers depend on China for sales, and the U.S. has
                                                also highlighted national security concerns with some Chinese companies.
                                                The agricultural industry in the U.S. has also been hugely impacted.
                                                China is the largest importer of U.S. soybeans and imposed retaliatory
                                                tariffs on these imports to the detriment of U.S. farmers. The sooner a
                                                comprehensive agreement can be reached, the sooner these industries can
                                                return to some kind of stability.</p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text"><strong>Jason Wulff:</strong> Very simply, it’s
                                                fundamentals. 2019 earnings for the S&P SmallCap 600
                                                Index are down 8.5%, while the S&P 500 is only down a little over 2%. A
                                                lot of it has been driven by the more cyclical sectors: energy,
                                                industrials, materials. Those areas see significantly steeper declines
                                                in terms of earnings estimates amongst smaller caps and large caps. This
                                                is not atypical; the business models tend to be more sensitive to
                                                changes in economic trends. We have seen, particularly with trade
                                                tensions and changing supply chains, that small-cap companies have been
                                                at a disadvantage in terms of sourcing from different places and having
                                                that negotiating leverage. Secondarily, we talk about investor
                                                positioning, generally toward what are perceived as higher quality,
                                                lower beta, more defensive issues, and traditionally that has been
                                                larger cap. In this market cycle, we’ve seen factor investing and
                                                stylistic investing accelerating and becoming a more meaningful driver
                                                of short-term results. That has had a bias toward the large cap.

                                                better expected earnings growth in 2020 should help close the gap a bit
                                                between large and small caps. Since September, we saw a bit of a market
                                                rotation into more value-oriented names with the expectation that we’ll
                                                see better earnings growth in 2020. That more risk-on behavior, at least
                                                in the equity market, should benefit small caps. To the extent that we
                                                get resolution on trade issues, that should also help small caps and be

                                        investors should watch closely in 2020 and why?</h6>

                                    <p class="cta-gray-text">We believe that the tariff war with China has been a key
                                        factor in the economic slowdown we are experiencing. However, it is our view
                                        that the majority of the slowdown has not been from the direct effect of the
                                        tariffs — the fact that we have to pay more for goods — but the indirect effects
                                        in the form of lower executive confidence. Lower business confidence has led to
                                        lower capital expenditures that in turn have led to a slower expansion in the
                                        economy. We believe it is likely that an easing of tariff tensions would inject
                                        new confidence for continued economic growth not only in the United States but
                                        worldwide.</p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">The outcome of the 2020 Presidential and
                                                Congressional elections will have a very substantial impact on U.S.
                                                domestic and foreign policy for years to come. The impact on economic

                                                for the Democratic nomination for president hold very different —
                                                sometimes diametrically opposite — views on key hot-button issues when
                                                compared to President Donald Trump. Democratic candidates are generally
                                                in favor of more regulation, higher taxes, and greater government
                                                involvement (particularly in healthcare), while Republicans are
                                                generally in favor of less regulation and fewer government programs
                                                (notwithstanding the fact that the annual government deficit now stands
                                                at over $1 trillion under President Trump). At Cougar Global, we expect
                                                President Trump to be re-elected in 2020, given the low unemployment
                                                rate and strong state of the economy. In this case, we are likely to see
                                                a continued regime of low taxes and regulations — a positive for stocks.
                                                However, there is a significant chance that — given the enormous wealth
                                                inequality in the U.S. (according to Forbes,1 the top three wealthiest
                                                individuals are worth more than the bottom 50% of the population) —
                                                voters could elect a left-leaning Democrat as president. This outcome
                                                would be less favorable for global growth and stocks, particularly for
                                                highly profitable healthcare companies. Several Democratic candidates
                                                have outlined “Medicare-for-All” initiatives that would curtail the
                                                profitability of private insurers and drug companies. </p>

                                                President Trump’s impeachment, there are no signs yet of an impact on
                                                his overall job approval ratings (as measured by Real Clear Politics) or
                                                support within the Republican Party (which stands at over 90%, according
                                                to a recent Gallup poll). Given that Democrats are unlikely to convince
                                                enough (if any) Republicans in the Senate to remove President Trump from
                                                office, the impeachment at this point is largely political theater. In
                                                our view, voters, not Congress, will decide in 2020 whether President
                                                Trump or a Democrat will occupy the White House for the next four years.
                                                On the latter, former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth
                                                Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and former New
                                                York Mayor Mike Bloomberg all seem to be contenders. </p>

                                        sentiment around this noise present potential opportunities? </h6>

                                    <p class="cta-gray-text">Political disorder over the past few years, and the past
                                        year especially, portends persistent political uncertainty. Political rhetoric
                                        pervades the market as a whole, and many, if not all, sectors will experience
                                        periods of heightened volatility during the upcoming election year although
                                        healthcare, energy, and technology remain top of mind as those most affected in
                                        the near term as presidential candidates promote policy recommendations.
                                        Additionally, based on valuation metrics, the broader U.S. market looks rather
                                        expensive, and those among the most volatile during a regime shift, including
                                        financials, energy, and industrials, are currently significantly undervalued vs.
                                        the broader market. With that, we note these short-term volatility spikes
                                        coincide with periods of heightened political uncertainty, so while day-to-day
                                        and/or week-to-week fluctuations may seem significant, the stock market tends to
                                        trend upward over the long run, regardless of who is elected and their
                                        represented party. Accordingly, in highly volatile areas of the market, we tend
                                        to play defense and stay closer to the “middle of the boat.” </p>

                                                monetary policy? </h6>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">Monetary policy has been largely ineffective, as
                                                central banks have shown limited ability to spur growth and inflation
                                                via monetary stimulus over the past 10+ years. Emergency policy measures
                                                were implemented in the midst of the Global Financial Crisis to prevent
                                                a complete collapse of the financial system. In that narrow framework,
                                                they have indeed been successful. These extremely accommodative policies
                                                have persisted for more than a decade, however, much longer than anyone
                                                would have predicted, and their ongoing efficacy is questionable at
                                                best.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">The most obvious outcome of all of this liquidity
                                                sloshing around the globe has been the boosting of risk assets and the
                                                suppression of volatility. Global growth has been decent over this
                                                timeframe, but somewhat disappointing given the massive size of the
                                                stimulus, and generating inflation has proven all but impossible.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">Some will make the counterfactual argument that
                                                growth would have been much worse without the stimulus, and that we may
                                                have experienced outright deflation. This is unprovable, of course, but
                                                point granted. Perhaps we would now be in year 12 of another Great
                                                Depression without #QE4ever.
                                                The root problem, however, is not that the cost of money is too dear,
                                                choking off growth; money is in fact way too cheap and no one knows what
                                                to do with all of it.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">Looking ahead, central banks have fewer monetary
                                                policy levers to pull than they did in 2008. Negative yields and
                                                quantitative easing (QE) programs are pervasive, but most developed
                                                economies still face disinflation and sluggish growth. When the next
                                                cyclical downturn occurs, central banks could take risk-free rates into
                                                even deeper negative territory or add trillions more to their
                                                already-bloated balance sheets. But even if unconventional policy tools
                                                have become the norm, they are path-dependent and the starting point
                                                matters.</p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">Additional rate cuts may provide a short-term boost
                                                to equity markets, and more QE will compress bond yields even further,
                                                but this is unlikely to boost aggregate demand and capital expenditures.
                                                We have reached the monetary policy “event horizon,” the point where
                                                historical cause-and-effect relationships start to break down. The only
                                                likely policy impetus for a surge in growth and inflation would appear
                                                to be significant fiscal stimulus, which also faces long odds given the
                                                current political situation in both the U.S. and Europe. Although we
                                                believe it would be (yet more) folly, we cannot rule out the possibility
                                                of the Fed slashing rates and dragging U.S. yields towards the same
                                                black hole in which Japan and Europe are currently trapped.</p>

                                        <h6 class="partner-purple-text mb-4">After a relatively brief period of rising
                                            interest rates, the Fed has now shifted to a more accommodative stance,
                                            cutting the Fed funds rate several times and resuming balance sheet
                                            expansion. What kind of stimulus could this provide to the economy and
                                            capital markets? </h6>

                                        <p class="cta-gray-text"><strong>James Camp:</strong> I think the Federal
                                            Reserve’s activity in 2019 has been more a syncing up with what’s been going
                                            on globally than any sort of domestic stimulus. Through 2019, we saw an
                                            acceleration of negative-yielding debt globally, and a slowdown in real
                                            economic data in the United States. We view the Fed’s pivot in 2019 as
                                            merely a squaring of accounts — a move that was necessary to reconfigure the
                                            yield curve and keep the U.S. dollar and other indicators in line. The
                                            balance sheet expansion done in the face of the overnight market failures is
                                            — to us — a form of quantitative easing. We believe at this point in the
                                            market cycle it has diminishing marginal value for the real economy but is
                                            still stimulative for risk assets.</p>
                                        <p class="cta-gray-text"><strong>John Lagowski:</strong> It’s a matter of “How
                                            is this going to stimulate asset price inflation” vs. “What is this going to
                                            do for the economy?” Even if the data does start to stabilize here soon,
                                            there’s really not a catalyst for a meaningful rebound. One of the messages
                                            has been “stabilization is not necessarily reacceleration.”</p>
                                        <p class="cta-gray-text"><strong>Joe Jackson:</strong> It’s unlikely we will see
                                            the same reacceleration due to low rates and Fed easing that we saw
                                            previously during this expansion when companies were able to lever up. The
                                            migration in corporate bonds over the past 10 years from high investment
                                            grade to triple-B has been well documented, and it has its limits. Many
                                            corporations are pretty indebted right now, so I think the Fed’s actions are
                                            more of an attempt to keep the party going than something that will spur a
                                            big new wave of growth.</p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">Many of the traditional “value” sectors of the
                                                market are populated with industries that can be negatively impacted by
                                                lower interest rates (banks, insurance, financials); trade uncertainties
                                                and macroeconomic weakness (metals, chemicals, automotive, energy); and
                                                political changes (energy, HMOs, pharmaceuticals, financials). We
                                                believe the distinction between “value” and “growth” stocks can be an
                                                artificial one, often a matter of subjective opinion. We have sometimes
                                                perceived that certain “growth” stocks are actually more attractively
                                                valued in our opinion than so-called “value” stocks. In a global economy
                                                where economic growth is decelerating and can be scarce due to
                                                structural issues of aging demographics, high debt levels, and
                                                relatively high domestic interest rates, companies that can grow
                                                organically can trade at a premium and perhaps have better performing
                                                stock prices than companies that lack organic volume growth or pricing
                                                power. We think meaningful trade deals, should they occur, would help
                                                lift interest rates and boost many “value” stocks, which is what
                                                happened starting in September. Longer term, we believe the more
                                                innovative and faster growing corners of the market often retain an
                                                advantage for performance due to superior competitive dynamics and
                                                business models that drive pricing power and volume growth. With weak
                                                pricing power in many “value” industries and persistently low interest
                                                rates, some “value” stocks may continue to struggle unless there is a
                                                persistent change in the global economy.</p>

                                                third quarter. All other things equal, this is a positive for value
                                                stocks, although most factors continue to favor growth. If the Federal

                                                higher. Some inflation can be beneficial for cyclical value stocks over
                                                longer duration growth stocks.</p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">In our view, three main drivers have rewarded
                                                growth stocks:</p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">1. The relative scarcity of growth: Growth has been
                                                hard to come by, so sustainable growth stocks
                                                become the scarce asset and relatively more valuable. Pre-2008 real GDP
                                                growth after the
                                                1999-2000 recession was 2.7%. Real GDP growth since 2010 (post the Great
                                                Recession) has been
                                                1.7%. Numerous reasons have been given for slow growth this past decade
                                                such as declining
                                                productivity, debt hangovers, and the effects of China’s massive capital
                                                over-investment for a decade
                                                and a half.</p>
                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">2. Change in the margin growth pecking order: The
                                                large-cap investment universe has changed
                                                drastically since 2000. The high-margin firms are also the high-growth
                                                firms, largely due to the rise of
                                                technology monopolies. To make the top quintile of large firms in terms
                                                of free cash flow margins in
                                                1998, a firm needed to be at the 10% level. In 2019, a top quintile
                                                ranking requires a 20% free cash flow
                                                margin. This is a key point and ties into the slow growth issue: In a
                                                world of slow growth and low rates,
                                                free cash flow margins of 20% compounding at even mid-single digits is a
                                                mechanism for enormous
                                                wealth creation. Barring anti-trust moves, our forecast shows little to
                                                stop this phenomenon.
                                                Economic recoveries and a trade deal may support short-term value
                                                recoveries but a long-term value
                                                run may require a collapse in the cycle and its ensuing recovery.</p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">3. Low real rates favor long-duration assets: Real
                                                interest rates (nominal rates minus inflation
                                                expectations) are at all-time lows relative to history. Long-duration
                                                assets such as growth stocks are
                                                very valuable with these low discount rates. The bigger question might
                                                be: What type of world gives us
                                                these century-low rates? It suggests massive past capital
                                                over-investment and idle capacity relative
                                                to demand, a thought which is in the back of all of our minds.</p>

                                            <p class="cta-gray-text">While the landscape looks better for value and
                                                small-cap stocks with the un-inversion of the yield curve, we believe
                                                growth stocks will continue to show strength.</p>

                                        outperformance of growth vs. value throughout most of 2019, with a sharp

                                        between growth and value sectors and any forces you think could impact this

                                        2000® Value Index through late 2019. Over the past 10 years, growth indexes for
                                        both small and large Russell and S&P 500 indexes have outperformed value.
                                        However, for longer time periods, the Russell 2000® Value Index has outperformed
                                        Growth. For the S&P indexes, growth has outperformed over the last 20+ years.

                                    <p class="cta-gray-text">For the past 10 years, growth has been driven by strong
                                        returns in technology and healthcare, while energy has held back value. Lower
                                        interest rates may have also contributed to this divergence. Over longer time
                                        periods, value has outperformed growth, but in the current economic environment
                                        growth has the edge.</p>
